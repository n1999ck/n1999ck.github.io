The history of art is long and storied; we have been creating since the dawn of mankind. Art grew and transformed over the millennia, shaping us as we shaped it, becoming the discipline it is today. Humans have used art in religion, communication, business, expression … it’s permeating.

JavaScript is basically the same way. Hear me out.

The World Wide Web exploded onto the scene in 1995 - the dawn of the Information Age. As humans and the Internet intertwined, some smart people at Netscape saw the need for interactivity on the Web. The project was handed to developer Brendan Eich, and within six months JavaScript was released. We have grown together with the Internet and JavaScript. It’s the language driving our connections, our entertainment, our businesses, our neuroses.

With those weighty ideas set out, I can move to the actual article. This began as an assignment to create a presentation about a programming language. I chose JavaScript because I’m a web developer, and decided to match topics with pieces of historic art because I’m also an art historian. I had a blast finding some pretty esoteric connections, so now I’m writing them out to share.

## Part 1: JavaScript 
### Alphonse Mucha, Untitled

We start with some pretty literal takes on the topic: ladies holding coffee.

Alphonse Mucha had a real gift for painting pretty ladies. This woman’s rosy, kind face, red hair, and relaxed posture make the painting look calm and welcoming. The negative space is a textured gradient of blue to yellow - a quick but effective background. Her yellow dress fades into the bottom of the frame and the woman becomes monolithic, a henge on the cafe floor. The coffee she holds balances out the composition with its steam.

Not unlike this woman, JavaScript is a monolith of the Web. It’s the only language you can write for the Web in!! The usual choice a programmer has is gone, for better or worse. 

Aubrey Beardsley was pretty out there. His illustrations were unique when they were made and they’re still unique a hundred years later.


## Part 2: JavaScript: I Don’t Like It
### Gustave Courbet, The Desperate Man

Gustave Courbet was a troubled artist like many others. He sometimes created erotic celebrations of the female body, sometimes grim funeral scenes, sometimes narrative scenes. This piece is one of many self portraits Courbet created with a painful energy.

This is also a pretty accurate depiction of how I tend to look as I push my way through brackets upon brackets of JavaScript code.

## Part 3: JavaScript
### Louise Bourgeois, Maman, 1990

Maman is one of Bourgeois’s many spider sculptures. Its massive sinewy form lords over viewers. The spiders were inspired by Bourgeois’s mother (maman is French for “momma”), who was a weaver, helpful, and protective.

JavaScript is what we use to weave the modern Web together. Its presence is just as overbearing online as Maman in its space.

## Part 4: JavaScript History
### Charles Willson Peale, The Exhumation of the Mastodon

History paintings were very common in 18th and 19th century Europe, typically depicting classical (as in Greco-Roman) or Biblical scenes. In grand, Neoclassical style, typical history paintings contained numerous figures, perfectly painted in poses emulating Roman marbles. The Exhumation of the Mastodon is an interesting example of an early American painter trying his hand at a history painting - of a contemporary subject.

Charles Willson Peale was one of America’s first museum collectors and hobby paleontologists. At the time, evolutionary theory was in its pre-infancy. Charles Darwin hadn’t yet released his explosive *On the Origin of Species*, but people were beginning to whisper Enlightenment-era ideas about life’s origins. 

Discoveries of fossilized dinosaurs and mastodons were causing confusion and debate over the concept of extinction. The prevailing view among Westerners at the time held that God had created the world in an essentially perfect, therefore unchanging, state. Every species of animal, every hill or valley, was a result of divine intervention. Mountains didn't move, and species didn't die out or form anew. 

Fossilized mastodon teeth and bones had been found around the Northeast. What was one to make of these discoveries? Where did these elephantine remains come from? According to Thomas Jefferson, these were evidence of the American Elephant, still roaming in the Pacific Northwest. To Puritan Cotton Mather, the bones were proof that the Biblical Nephilim - giants - had roamed New England.

Peale heard about a new discovery of mastodon bones and decided to add them to his museum. He excavated the remains himself, and painted *The Exhumation of the Mastodon* as a history painting to memorialize the act.

What was this post about again? JavaScript? Oh yeah. Uh, history painting for JavaScript history. *Exhumation* is a lot of fun to write about, so I'll be making another post about it.
